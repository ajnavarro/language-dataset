    (* DISCUSSION - On Nu's authoring story...

    Instead of using a single, general purpose scripting language for authoring tasks in Nu, we use
    a small set of domain-specific languages. For example, the simulant system uses s-expression-
    based DSLs, as does the overlay, asset graph, and effect system. The simulation interactions
    are defined with chains directly in F#.

    What follows is a matrix of engine systems and the authoring language they provide to the user -

    system          | language                  | editor
    -----------------------------------------------------------
    simulants defs  | s-expr DSL                | Gaia
    event filtering | s-expr DSL                | Gaia
    collision bodies| s-expr DSL                | Gaia
    overlay         | s-expr DSL                | Visual Studio & Gaia
    asset graph     | s-expr DSL                | Visual Studio & Gaia
    script language | s-expr DSL                | Visual Studio & Gaia
    effect system   | s-expr DSL                | Gaia & Aether (TBA)
    mind (TBA)      | s-expr DSL                | Gaia & Pheobe (TBA) - http://www.cs.uu.nl/research/techreps/repo/CS-2013/2013-003.pdf
    interactions    | F# (chains)               | Visual Studio
    subsystems      | F#                        | Visual Studio
    components      | F# (facets / dispatchers) | Visual Studio
    elmish / MMC    | F# (facets / dispatchers) | Visual Studio

    The advantages and limitations that fall out of this is as such -

    The systems that provide an s-expr DSL have their DSLs interpreted at run-time and, unlike code
    in F#, allow for hot-reloading for optimal authoring experiences. For these systems, however,
    no static checking is in place, allowing for trivial errors.

    For the system that isn't interpreted, a strong type system is in place to make sure complex
    data-flow dependencies are made explicit and checked with good error messages. For this system,
    however, no hot-reloading is possible, negatively impacting the authoring experience.

    The trade-offs for each given domain does seem to be appropriate. While the simulant system
    MUST be run-time in order to be WYSIWYG editable, the interaction system isn't too badly
    affected by the need for program restarts, and benefits proportionately from having an
    expressive static type system. *)

    (* WISDOM - Dealing with different device resolutions - Instead of rendering each component
    scaled to a back-buffer of a varying size, render each component unscaled to an off-screen
    buffer of a static size and then blit that with scaling to the back-buffer. NOTE: this only
    applies to 2D ~ will not apply to 3D once implemented in Nu (for obvious reasons). *)

    (* WISDOM: On avoiding threads where possible...
    
    Beyond the cases where persistent threads are absolutely required or where transient threads
    implement embarassingly parallel processes, threads should be AVOIDED as a rule.
    
    If it were the case that physics were processed on a separate hardware component and thereby
    ought to be run on a separate persistent thread, then the proper way to approach the problem of
    physics system queries is to copy the relevant portion of the physics state from the PPU to main
    memory every frame. This way, queries against the physics state can be done IMMEDIATELY with no
    need for complex intermediate states (albeit against a physics state that is one frame old). *)

    (* WISDOM: On threading physics...
    
    A simulation that would put physics on another thread should likely do so in a different app
    domain with communication via .NET remoting to make 100% sure that no sharing is happening.
    This should keep debugging easy and even possibly give a boost to GC latency what with
    spreading collection pauses across two separate collectors.
    
    NOTE: AppDomains are discontinued in .NET Core -
    https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/02/10/porting-to-net-core/
    It is suggested instead to run in separate processes, which is fine. *)

    (* WISDOM: Keep all animation frame numbers even. That way, you can simply halve them if you
    need to move the app from 60fps to 30fps. *)

    (* WISDOM: No need for multiple instances of the same Facet...
    
    Unity allows users to have multiple instances of the same Component (the OO equivalent of Nu's
    Facets). Nu does not want or need this because -
    
    a) Nu's programming models allows interfacing with Facet properties directly rather than having
    to dig out the desired Facet then interfacing with it.
    
    b) If a user wants an Entity to be composed of multiple reusable pieces, that's what child Entities
    are for.
    
    Now, one may take an exception to point b for performance issues, but in those cases, one would
    instead contrive a Facet that contains multiples of the desired element in the same way that
    the EffectFacet can host multiple Effects. It can be inconvenient, but the inconvenience seems
    otherwise marginal. *)

    (* IDEA: Networking

    Networking will be done with Chain'd network events.
    For server-based networking, we will use the input-propagation approach like is done with Overwatch.
    For peer-to-peer networking, we will use simulant state-propagation like is done with my AR project
    with Unity. *)

    (* IDEA: it was suggested that time-travel debugging a la Elm or http://vimeo.com/36579366
    would be appropriate to this engine given its pure functional nature. *)
