  { TMsgVersion

    This message is sent after the ping/pong handshake
    and after the 'client' message to tell the other
    side the version of the client software. This
    message is optional but all clients usually
    implement it. It has the following structure:

      version <versionnumber>

    <versionnumber>  a string with the version number

    When receiving this message we store the version
    number temporarily (we don't persist it) and the
    GUI may show it as additional information along
    with the client software name for each buddy in
    a mouse-over hint window or in a separate info-
    dialog.
