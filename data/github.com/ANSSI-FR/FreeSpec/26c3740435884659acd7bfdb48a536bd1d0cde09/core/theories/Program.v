(** * The [Program] Monad *)

(** In this section, we introduce the [Program] Monad. Its definition
    was originally inspired by the Haskell #<a
    href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/operational">#operational#</a>#
    package, and then has been simplified following the example of the
    [itree] (see “From C to Interaction Trees” by the DeepWeb
    project).

    Thanks to the [Program] Monad, it becomes easy to
    specify complex programs with effects which belong to a given
    interface. *)

(*  To realize a given program, the [runProgram] function is
    provided. This functions takes an operational [Sem.t] in
    addition to a [Program] and returns the result of the computation
    along with a new operational semantics. Two helpers functions
    ([evalProgram] and [execProgram]) are provided. *)

(** ** Definition

    Given [I] a set of effects (that is, of kind [Interface])
    and [A] the type of the result of a given program, the type of
    this computation specification is [Program I A].

    Under the hood, an instance of the [Program] monad wraps and
    chains several calls to an underlying interface. More precisely,
    [Program] has two constructors:

    - [Pure a], which describes the (pure) computation of the value
      [a]
    - [Request i f], which describes a call to the underlying
      interface through the instruction [i] and a continuation [f] to
      process this result *)

Inductive Program
          (I:  Interface)
          (A:  Type) :=
| Pure (a:  A)
  : Program I A
| Request {B:  Type}
          (e:  I B)
          (f:  B -> Program I A)
  : Program I A.

Arguments Pure [I A] (a).
Arguments Request [I A B] (e f).

(** ** Working with Arbitrary Interfaces *)

(** In practice, one computation may require more than one
    [Interface]s, which means we need to be able to compose Interfaces
    together. The Library [FreeSpec.Compose] provides several
    abstraction to that end.

    This poses a challenge in terms of [Program] specifications
    reusability. Thanks to the [bind] function, [Program]
    specifications can be composed together, but #<i>#they need to
    share the same [Interface]#</i>#. To overcome this challenge, we
    follow the example of the Haskell #<a
    href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/extensible-effects">#extensible-effects#</a>#
    package. Thanks to the [Use] typeclass, we can specify which
    interfaces a given [Program] specification uses, yet leave the
    actual interface abstract. *)
Class Use (i ix: Interface)
  := { lift_eff (a:  Type): i a -> ix a
     }.

(** The most obvious instance of [Use] is [Use i i]. *)
Instance Instance_Use (i: Interface): Use i i :=
  { lift_eff := fun _ => id
  }.

Arguments lift_eff [i ix _ a] (e).

Class Cons
      (X Rst: Type)
  : Type :=
  { proj_x:    X
  ; proj_rst:  Rst
  }.

Class Nil: Type.

Ltac use_many :=
  match goal with
  | |- Cons _ _ => constructor; [typeclasses eauto | use_many]
  | |- Nil => constructor
  end.

Hint Extern 20 (Cons _ _) => use_many: typeclass_instances.
Hint Extern 10 (Use _ _) => (match goal with
                             | H: context[Use ?i ?ix] |- Use ?i ?ix => apply H
                             end) : typeclass_instances.

Notation "ix ':|' i1 ',' i2 ',' .. ',' i3" :=
  (Cons (Use i1 ix) (Cons (Use i2 ix) .. (Cons (Use i3 ix) Nil) ..))
    (at level 78, i1, i2, i3 at next level, no associativity).
Notation "ix ':|' i" :=
  (Use i ix)
    (at level 78, i at next level, no associativity).

(** Using the [Use] typeclass, we can implement a more generic
    replacement of the old definition of the [Request]
    constructor.

    As a reminder, in the first iterations of FreeSpec, [Request] was
    a constructor of type [i a -> Program i a], to model a computation
    that consists in waiting for the result of an operation and
    returning this very result.

    We now introduce [request]. Its purposes is similar, but thanks to
    [Use], this functions can be used more easily in a [Program]
    specification with a different interface type. *)
Definition request
           {i:   Type -> Type}
           {ix:  Type -> Type} `{ix :| i}
           {a:   Type}
           (e:   i a)
  : Program ix a :=
  Request (lift_eff e) (@Pure ix a).

(** ** Monad Laws

    [Program] _is_ a Monad and therefore obeys the Monad laws.  The
    #<a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Monad_laws">#Haskell Wiki#</a>#
    explains in depth what are the laws and why they are usefull. In a
    nutshell, the laws are intended to ease the use of a given Monad
    by a programmer by making the monad functionning in general more
    predictible. By conforming to the Monad laws, one knows its monad
    will have more chance to behave the way its users may expect it
    to.

    Fortunately, in our case, proving the Monad laws is
    straightforward. *)
