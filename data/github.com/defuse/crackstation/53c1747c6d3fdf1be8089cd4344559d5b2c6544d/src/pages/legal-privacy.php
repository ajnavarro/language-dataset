<h1>CrackStation's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy</h1>

<h2>Terms of Service</h2>
<p>
CrackStation's main goal is to promote the use of properly implemented salted
hashing in new and existing web applications. We provide this service to help
security researchers demonstrate the importance of hash salting. Any users that
choose to use CrackStation as a malicious tool are solely responsible for their
own actions. We do not ask where our clients get their hashes, so we are unable
to help any law enforcement agency.
</p>

<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
CrackStation respects the privacy of its users. Your IP address and web browser
information may be logged as you request web pages from this site, but we do not
sell that information or share that information with anyone. We DO NOT log the
hashes that you crack.  However, you should still not try to crack the hash of
your own password or other sensitive information, since your connection might be
being intercepted by the NSA.
